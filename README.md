# Application Assignment 1

A to do list that is capable of holding at least 100 unique items, with the option to add new items,
delete items, clear the entire list, filter based on status, save the list to a text file and open a text file.

# Adding, Deleting, Editing data

When adding a new item, add a title and a description in the textfields, click the add task button to add the new item in the list. When a new item is added a date picker box is
generated with the current date set as the default date, but it can be changed at anytime or just left blank. 

You can edit the description by double-clicking on the row and change it completely.

The delete button will delete the highlighted item while the clear all button clears the entire list.

# Filter

Every new item is by default marked as incomplete, which can be changed by double clicking on it and setting it to complete.

The filter list drop down box will let you view either all the items, only complete items, or only incomplete items.

# Save and open text files

The save drop down menu item will save the current list into a text file.

The open drop down menu item should open a text file and load the list into a new table.
